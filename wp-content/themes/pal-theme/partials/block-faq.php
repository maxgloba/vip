		<span class="faq--question">What are CICs?</span>
		<span class="faq--answer">CIC stands for “Completely In Canal.” These are a special type of hearing device that fits comfortably and snugly into your ear canal, without arching over your ear. CICs are perfect for those who would like to improve their hearing, without “feeling” like they are wearing a large, bulky hearing aid.</span>
